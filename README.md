# RaagGayan
A repo for songs and their respective ragas, to be made in md

I have made this repository to store all the ragas [aka raags] and their respective songs, later on we can think about adding programs that will help us in finding a suitable song or do a backwards search to find the details of a song



If you do wish to contribute then I urge you to use this preferred format below so as to easily consolidate data

Format - 

1. At start of every file
 [NAME OF RAAG]
 Thaath -
 Jati -
 Vadi swar -
 Samvadi swar -
 Vikrit swar -
 Varjit swar -
 Gayan samay -
 Visheshta -
 
 close ragas [find suitable name, like chayaraag and all]


2. At start of song lists of that respective raag
 [SONG NAME] - [MOVIE NAME] - [SINGER/LYRICIST/PRODUCER]




Thank you for your time
